# CODEBOOK

## Variables

The data contains the following variables:

1. Subject - representing the subject ID
2. Activity - representing the activity performed by the subject
3. Measureament - several measurements as described in the next section

## Measureament

The following variables are mean and std from the measuares obtained from the original data.

## Modifications

* Only the mean and std measurements were kept
* The train and test data were merged
* Every character non-alphanumeric from the names were removed
* The style first letter of the word as capital was adopted for the variables names
* The activity was change from a numeric identifier to a label
